# ganeti hook for growing (resize) a qemu/KVM disk online
#
#   !!!!! use at your own risk !!!!!
#
# please note: due to needed naming conventions of disks inside qemu, this 
# hook needs at least ganeti-2.10 or newer
#
# potential data lose:
# ----------------------
# For file based instances (disk template file or sharedfile) there is a 
# risk of losing data (shrinking the disk). The reason is, that the qemu HMP
# command block_resize sets the size of the disk/file on its own (after
# ganeti has grown the disk/file). If something in this hook went wrong, you
# may end up with a shrunken disk.
# 
# The same may be true for rbd template (can't test this).
# 
# Host block devices like DRBD, LVM or blockdev template are safe, because
# qemu does nothing expect to get the new size from the device and notify
# the guest.
#
# To prevent users from overlooking this warning you have to place a 
# confirmation variable into this script. The variable's name is
# RUN_ON_UNSAFE_DISK_TEMPLATES and its value is I_DONT_CARE_FOR_DATALOSE.

### Installation instrunctions
#   * copy this script into 
#     /etc/ganeti/hooks/disk-grow-post.d/ on every node
#   * make sure it is executable
#
#   You can use the following commands on the master node
#   to install this hook in your cluster
#
#   $ gnt-cluster command mkdir -p /etc/ganeti/hooks/disk-grow-post.d/
#   $ install -o root -g root -m 0700 /source/path/to/this/script /etc/ganeti/hooks/disk-grow-post.d/50-grow-disk-online
#   $ gnt-cluster copyfile /etc/ganeti/hooks/disk-grow-post.d/50-grow-disk-online
#
#   This hook will log into the instance's primary nodes syslog (i.e.
#   /var/log/syslog). Look there for general actions and errors.
#
#   In order to determine the instance's primary node make sure that
#   "hostname -f" is identical to ganeti's node name.
